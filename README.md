## Libraries and Digital Humanities

The Libraries and Digital Humanities Special Interest Group [(Lib&DH SIG)] (http://adho.org/sigs) was officially established in 2015 by the international Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations [(ADHO)] (http://adho.org).  With conveners from five different countries, the goals of this SIG are:

1. to offer advice and support to librarians engaged in digital humanities pursuits;
2. to advocate for initiatives of interest and benefit to both libraries and digital humanities; 
3. to document how librarians and library-based units meet the many challenges, and take advantage of the many opportunities, of DH librarianship; 
4. to provide information about available resources and opportunities (e.g., training, funding) that encourage collaboration between DH scholars in a variety of roles, especially in libraries; 
5. to showcase the work of librarians engaged in the digital humanities; and to promote librariansâ€™ perspectives and skills in the greater DH community worldwide.
